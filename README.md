## Data
1. countries.csv
	- a table with all alpha-numeric representations of countries. You may need to use this to standardise country codes to one format
2. fx_rates.csv
	- a table with fx rates. The timestamps are not at equal intervals and it does not include non-trivial conversions (e.g EUR -> EUR)
3. train_fraudsters.csv
	- this just holds a list of IDs of users who have been identified as fraudsters for this problem
4. train_transactions.csv
	- all transactions conducted by users in training set.
	- **amount** is denominated in integers at the lowest unit. e.g. 5000 GBP => 50 GBP (because the lowest unit in GBP is a penny, w/ 100 pence = 1 GBP)
	- **entry_method** is only relevant for card transactions (CARD_PAYMENT, ATM); you may ignore it for other transactions. The values are:
		misc - unknown
		chip - chip on card
		mags - magstripe on card
		manu - manual entry of card details
		cont - contactless/tap 
		mcon - special case of magstripe & contactless
	- **source** is associated with an external party we use for handling this type of transaction. (e.g. all {CARD_PAYMENT, ATM} use GAIA)
5. train_users.csv
	- a table of user data
	- **is_fraudster** column does not exist in the csv, it must populated in your ETL script by using the train_fraudsters.csv
	- **kyc** column indicates the status of the user's identity verification process
	- **terms_version** column indiciates the user's current version of the Revolut app
6. currency_details.csv
	- a table with iso codes and exponents for currencies
	- **exponent** column can be used to convert the integer amounts in the transactions table into cash amounts. (e.g for 5000 GBP, exponent = 2, so we apply: 5000/(10^2) = 50 GBP)


## Hints & Tips
1. Regardless of whether you use a statistical, ML or some other model - you should utilise features pertaining to a user. For simplicity we advise approaching question 3) in two main steps:
	* Create a class/method to generate all the necessary features for the users. The resulting features should be stored somewhere, statically.
	* Create a class/method to evaluate the fraud status of a user. It should take in a user_id, then retrieve the pre-computed features and return a result.
2. When we test your code we will run it against our test data. Thus, we will need to run your code to create the test features and yield test results.
3. The **is_fraudster** column in the **users** table does not need to be updated with the results of your model.
